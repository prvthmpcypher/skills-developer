### Security
- Patched XSS vulnerability in comment field
```
Write for users, not developers. "Fixed issue #234" is useless. "Fixed crash when saving files larger than 2GB" is useful. Lead with impact, not implementation.

## Critical rules
1. Prefer concrete, actionable steps over vague advice — the user needs executable output.
2. Ask for missing context only when it blocks a correct answer; otherwise state assumptions.
3. Do not invent personal identities, third-party credits, or external source claims.
