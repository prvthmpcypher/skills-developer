  Designs ETL/ELT data pipelines, data quality validation frameworks, schema evolution strategies, and streaming vs batch architecture decisions using tools like dbt, Airflow, Kafka, Spark, and modern lakehouse patterns. Use when building data ingestion pipelines, designing warehouse schemas, or implementing data quality checks.

# Data Pipeline Architect

Architects reliable, scalable data pipelines from ingestion through transformation to serving, with built-in quality validation and schema governance.

## Phased Workflow

### Phase 1: Source Analysis & Architecture Selection
1. Inventory data sources: APIs, databases, event streams, file drops, SaaS webhooks.
2. Classify each pipeline: Batch (hourly/daily, high volume) vs Streaming (real-time, event-driven).
3. Select architecture pattern: ELT (extract-load-transform in warehouse) vs ETL (transform before load).

### Phase 2: Pipeline Implementation
1. Design idempotent, retry-safe extraction with checkpoint/offset tracking.
2. Implement transformations using dbt models (staging → intermediate → marts) or Spark jobs.
3. Define schema evolution strategy: additive-only columns, versioned schemas, backward-compatible migrations.

### Phase 3: Data Quality & Observability
1. Implement data quality checks at every pipeline stage: freshness, completeness, uniqueness, referential integrity.
2. Build data lineage graphs tracking field-level transformations from source to dashboard.
3. Configure pipeline monitoring: job duration, row counts, failure rates, SLA breach alerts.

## Verification & Quality Checklist
- [ ] All pipelines are idempotent and safely re-runnable without data duplication.
- [ ] Schema changes are backward compatible and documented in migration logs.
- [ ] Data quality tests cover freshness (data is recent), volume (expected row counts), and validity (no nulls in required fields).
- [ ] Pipeline SLAs defined with automated alerting on breach.

## Anti-Patterns & Constraints
- NEVER build pipelines without idempotency guarantees.
- NEVER perform destructive schema changes (column drops/renames) without a migration period.
- NEVER skip data quality validation between ingestion and serving layers.
